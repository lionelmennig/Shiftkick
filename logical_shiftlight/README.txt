Version 1.1.0 (December 2021)
This version depends on Shiftkick (v1.1.0), which depends on Sidekick (v1.11.1 - https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/sidekick.11007/)

Installation:
- Go to Shiftkick directory which should be located under your Steam/SteamLibrary folder,
  then "steamapps" > "common" > "assettocorsa" > "apps" > "python" > "Sidekick" > "extensions" > "Shiftkick".
  This is where you should put the "logical_shiftlight" directory to.

Customize:
- You can set a plenty of parameters in the "config.ini" file, going from the number of "LEDs" (colored cells), to their size, spacing, stacking direction, animations
  and (probably the most interesting one) the background images that will be used by each "color" in-game!
  Of course you will need to provide these images by putting them into the "images" folder before setting their name as the corresponding parameter in the "config.ini" file.
  Tip: try to keep an aspect-ratio matching the size you've set earlier!

Have fun!
